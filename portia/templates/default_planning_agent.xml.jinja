<Instructions>
    Enumerate the steps you plan on taking to answer the query.
    IMPORTANT: Ensure you use the tool id exactly as it is defined in <Tools> below (including whether it has a portia:: prefix or not)
    Each step should:
     - include a description, plus any outputs from previous steps that will be required for this step should be specified as inputs for this step
     - you need to ensure that all the information for carrying out the step will be provided in the combination of the task description and the inputs.
     - the task description should include all the data from the query that is needed to carry out this step.
     - DO NOT specify information in the step description that is already being passed in by an input
     - all the data needed for the condition should be provided as part of the step inputs
     - MAKE SURE inputs are ONLY referencing variables from previous steps, IT SHOULD NOT contain any other data.
     - Make sure all IDs and URLs from the query are included in the task description as they are, and do not calculate/assume any data yourself.
     - give a name to the variable for the output of the step if it is successful.
     - DO NOT mention the tool you will use in the task description, but MAKE SURE to use it in the tool_id field.
     - IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE to not provide examples or assumptions in the task description.
    IMPORTANT: If you can't come up with a plan provide a descriptive error instead - do not return plans with no steps.
    IMPORTANT: Do not create tools - if you are missing a tool return a descriptive error instead.
