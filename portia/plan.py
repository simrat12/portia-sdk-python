"""Plan primitives used to define and execute runs.

This module defines the core objects that represent the plan for executing a PlanRun.
The `Plan` class is the main structure that holds a series of steps (`Step`) to be executed by an
agent in response to a query. Each step can have inputs, an associated tool, and an output.
Variables can be used within steps to reference other parts of the plan or constants.

Classes in this file include:

- `Variable`: A variable used in the plan, referencing outputs of previous steps or constants.
- `Step`: Defines a single task that an agent will execute, including inputs and outputs.
- `ReadOnlyStep`: A read-only version of a `Step` used for passing steps to agents.
- `PlanContext`: Provides context about the plan, including the original query and available tools.
- `Plan`: Represents the entire series of steps required to execute a query.

These classes facilitate the definition of runs that can be dynamically adjusted based on the
tools, inputs, and outputs defined in the plan.
