"""Provides execution context to the planning and execution agents.

This module defines the `ExecutionContext` class and utilities for managing execution
contexts for planning and execution agents. It provides a way to pass runtime-specific information
for each run execution, ensuring flexibility and context isolation, especially in
multi-threaded or asynchronous applications.

Key Features:
- The `ExecutionContext` class encapsulates information such as user identification,
  additional data, and system context extensions for planning and execution agents.
- The `execution_context` context manager allows for context isolation, ensuring
  that each task or thread has its own independent execution context.
- The `get_execution_context` function allows retrieval of the current execution context.

    """Set the execution context for the duration of the PlanRun.

    This context manager ensures context isolation by using `contextvars.ContextVar`,
    meaning that the execution context set within this block will only affect
    the current task or thread. This is particularly useful in both multi-threaded
    and asynchronous applications, such as web servers or task queues, where multiple
    tasks or threads may need independent contexts simultaneously.

    Args:
        context (Optional[ExecutionContext]): The execution context to set for the current task.
            If not provided, a new `ExecutionContext` is created using the provided parameters.
        end_user_id (Optional[str]): An identifier for the end user, used to customize
            the execution for specific users. Defaults to `None`.
        additional_data (Optional[Dict[str, str]]): Arbitrary additional data to associate
            with the context. Defaults to an empty dictionary.
        planning_agent_system_context_extension (Optional[list[str]]): Additional context for
            planning_agents. This should be concise to stay within the context window.
        agent_system_context_extension (Optional[list[str]]): Additional context for agent
            LLMs. This should also be concise.

    Yields:
        None: The block of code within the context manager executes with the specified context.

    Context Isolation:
        - The `_execution_context` object is a `ContextVar`, ensuring that the `ExecutionContext`
          set in one task or thread does not affect others.
        - When the context manager exits, the context for the current task is cleaned up
          to avoid memory leaks or unintended persistence of data.

    Example:
    ```python
        with execution_context(end_user_id="user123", additional_data={"key": "value"}):
            # Code here runs with the specified execution context
        # Outside the block, the execution context is cleared for the current task.
