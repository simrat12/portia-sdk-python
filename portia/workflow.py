"""Workflows are executing instances of a Plan.

A workflow encapsulates all execution state, serving as the definitive record of its progress.
As the workflow runs, its `WorkflowState`, `current_step_index`, and `outputs` evolve to reflect
the current execution state.

The workflow also retains an `ExecutionContext`, which provides valuable insights for debugging
and analytics, capturing contextual information relevant to the workflow's execution.

Key Components
--------------
- **WorkflowState**: Tracks the current status of the workflow (e.g., NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS).
- **current_step_index**: Represents the step within the plan currently being executed.
- **outputs**: Stores the intermediate and final results of the workflow.
- **ExecutionContext**: Provides contextual metadata useful for logging and performance analysis.
